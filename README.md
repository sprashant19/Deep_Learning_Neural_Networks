- CIFAR-10: 10-class image dataset

## Steps
- Load datasets
- Build simple dense layers
- Visualize sample images

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

## Output

## Insights from Visualizations


MNIST Dataset (Second Image):

  1. The image represents a handwritten digit "5" from the MNIST dataset.

  2. MNIST consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.

  3. It is mainly used for digit recognition tasks and serves as a fundamental benchmark for deep learning models in computer vision.

  4. The clarity and simplicity of the handwritten digit make it ideal for training classification models.

CIFAR-10 Dataset (First Image):

  1. The CIFAR-10 image depicts a class label "6", which corresponds to "frog" in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

  2. CIFAR-10 images are 32x32 pixels in size and colored (RGB).

  3. The images are more complex and detailed compared to MNIST, covering 10 different classes like airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

  4. This dataset is commonly used for object recognition in small-scale natural scenes.
